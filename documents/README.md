# Teaclave SGX SDK Documentation

Welcome to the Teaclave Rust-SGX SDK[[1]](documents/ccsp17.pdf) [[2]](https://dingelish.com/ccs19.pdf) documentation wiki. To help users understand our project and know how to use it, we are writing some articles. Please join our [mailing list](https://teaclave.apache.org/community/#mailing-lists) if you'd like to see other topics. We'll add it as soon as possible.

Please read our documentation for SDK crates which can be found [here]( https://teaclave.apache.org/api-docs/sgx-sdk/sgx_tstd/index.html) or can be autogenerated with `cargo doc`.
